# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems

## What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI framework that combines information retrieval with text generation. It enhances large language models by providing them with relevant, up-to-date information from external knowledge sources, enabling more accurate and factual responses.

## How RAG Works

### 1. Query Processing
- User submits a question or request
- System processes and understands the query intent
- Query is prepared for retrieval

### 2. Information Retrieval
- System searches through knowledge base/documents
- Uses vector similarity or keyword matching
- Retrieves most relevant information chunks
- Applies relevance scoring and ranking

### 3. Context Integration
- Retrieved information is formatted as context
- Context is combined with user query
- System prepares enhanced prompt for LLM

### 4. Response Generation
- LLM generates answer using provided context
- Response is grounded in retrieved information
- System can cite sources and provide transparency

## Components of RAG Systems

### Document Ingestion
- **Document Loaders**: Support for various file formats (PDF, Markdown, Word)
- **Text Chunking**: Intelligent splitting of documents into manageable pieces
- **Metadata Extraction**: Preserving document structure and context
- **Version Control**: Tracking document updates and changes

### Vector Database
- **Embedding Generation**: Converting text to numerical vectors
- **Index Building**: Creating searchable vector representations
- **Similarity Search**: Finding relevant content based on vector similarity
