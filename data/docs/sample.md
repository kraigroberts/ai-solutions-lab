# Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. It involves algorithms that can identify patterns in data and use them to make predictions or decisions.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data. The model learns to map input features to known output labels. Common applications include:
- Image classification
- Spam detection
- Medical diagnosis
- Credit risk assessment

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data. The model discovers structure without predefined outputs. Examples include:
- Customer segmentation
- Anomaly detection
- Topic modeling
- Dimensionality reduction

### Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning learns through interaction with an environment. The agent receives rewards or penalties for actions and learns optimal strategies. Applications include:
- Game playing
- Robotics
- Autonomous vehicles
- Resource management

## Key Concepts

### Features and Labels
- **Features**: Input variables that the model uses to make predictions
- **Labels**: The correct answers for supervised learning tasks
- **Training Data**: The dataset used to teach the model
- **Test Data**: Data used to evaluate model performance

### Model Training
The training process involves:
1. **Data Preparation**: Cleaning and preprocessing the data
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating relevant input features
3. **Model Selection**: Choosing appropriate algorithms
4. **Training**: Optimizing model parameters
