# Machine Learning Fundamentals

## Introduction

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
- **Definition**: Learning from labeled training data
- **Goal**: Predict outcomes for new, unseen data
- **Examples**: Classification, regression
- **Use Cases**: Spam detection, house price prediction, medical diagnosis

### Unsupervised Learning
- **Definition**: Learning from unlabeled data
- **Goal**: Discover hidden patterns and structures
- **Examples**: Clustering, dimensionality reduction
- **Use Cases**: Customer segmentation, anomaly detection, recommendation systems

### Reinforcement Learning
- **Definition**: Learning through interaction with environment
- **Goal**: Maximize cumulative reward over time
- **Examples**: Q-learning, policy gradients
- **Use Cases**: Game playing, robotics, autonomous systems

## Key Algorithms

### Classification Algorithms
- **Decision Trees**: Tree-like model for classification
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble of decision trees
- **Support Vector Machines**: Find optimal hyperplane for separation
- **Neural Networks**: Multi-layered computational models

### Regression Algorithms
- **Linear Regression**: Fit linear relationship between variables
- **Ridge/Lasso Regression**: Regularized linear regression
- **Random Forest Regression**: Ensemble method for regression
- **Neural Network Regression**: Deep learning for regression

### Clustering Algorithms
- **K-Means**: Partition data into K clusters
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Build nested clusters
- **DBSCAN**: Density-based clustering
- **Gaussian Mixture Models**: Probabilistic clustering

## Model Evaluation

### Metrics for Classification
- **Accuracy**: Proportion of correct predictions
- **Precision**: True positives / (True positives + False positives)
- **Recall**: True positives / (True positives + False negatives)
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

### Metrics for Regression
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Average squared difference
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Square root of MSE
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Average absolute difference
- **R-squared**: Proportion of variance explained

## Feature Engineering

### Importance
Feature engineering is crucial for ML success, often more important than algorithm choice.

### Techniques
- **Feature Selection**: Choose relevant features
- **Feature Scaling**: Normalize feature values
- **Feature Creation**: Generate new features from existing ones
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduce feature space

## Overfitting and Underfitting

### Overfitting
- Model performs well on training data but poorly on new data
- **Solutions**: More training data, regularization, early stopping

### Underfitting
- Model cannot capture underlying patterns in data
- **Solutions**: More complex model, better features, longer training

## Best Practices

1. **Data Quality**: Ensure clean, relevant, and sufficient data
2. **Cross-Validation**: Use k-fold cross-validation for reliable evaluation
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model parameters
4. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models for better performance
5. **Interpretability**: Choose models that can explain predictions
6. **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor model performance in production
